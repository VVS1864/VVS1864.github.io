My name is Vlad Simonov, I am tourist and I like to travel. 
I was traveling in the Mountains Caucasus, Polar and South Urals, 
Lake Baikal. Also I like visit the caves and especially I like to travel 
by bicycle, and I made  the bicycle trip in 2000 kilometers in the South Urals.

I work in industrial mountaineering and tree climbing.

In my free time, I enjoy programming. I develop a CAD program Samocad, which
I use for create simple engineering drawings. Also, I design and create 
3d models and I like something to tinkering with his own hands.
